        <h2>How We Calculate ROI</h2>
        <p><strong>Calculating cost-savings for time spent on low-impact work:</strong></p>
        <p>Estimated Average Manager Salary at SoluGrowth R600,000 per year (~R50,000 per month)</p>
        <p>Time Spent on Low-Impact Tasks (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/stop-wasting-your-most-precious-resource-middle-manage">McKinsey Insights</a>)</p>
        <p><strong>Targeted Reduction in Low-Impact Work</strong></p>
        <p>20% reduction in time spent on low-value tasks.</p>
        <p>20% of R240,000 = R48,000 saved per manager per year.</p>
        <p><strong>Company-Wide Gains</strong></p>
        <p>Across 25 managers, total savings from reducing time spent on low-impact work = R1.2 million per year in reduced time wasted.</p>
 
        <p><strong>Calculating cost-savings for time spent on unnecessary oversight:</strong></p>
        <p>Estimated Average Manager Salary at SoluGrowth R600,000 per year (~R50,000 per month)</p>
        <p>Time Spent on Task Oversight (<a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/for-smarter-decisions-empower-your-employees">McKinsey Insights</a>)</p>
        <p><strong>Targeted Reduction in Oversight</strong></p>
        <p>20% improvement in team execution means managers spend 20% less time on oversight.</p>
        <p>20% of R210,000 = R42,000 saved per manager per year.</p>
        <p><strong>Company-Wide Gains</strong></p>
        <p>Across 25 managers, total savings from improved team execution results in R1 million saved per year in recovered productivity. (R42,000 × 25 managers)</p>
 
        <p><strong>Calculating cost-savings on reducing employee turnover:</strong></p>
        <p>Estimated Average Employee Salary at SoluGrowth R300,000 per year (~R25,000 per month)</p>
        <p><strong>Turnover Risk Due to Lack of Structured Development</strong></p>
        <p>Employees currently without structured development plans: 59% of 250 employees = 148 employees</p>
        <p>Estimated turnover risk for these employees: Research suggests employees without clear career paths are more likely to leave. Assume 10% annual staff turnover.</p>
        <p>Estimated number of employees lost annually due to lack of structured growth: 148 × 10% = 15 employees per year.</p>
        <p>Estimated cost of replacing an employee: 50% of salary (R150,000 per lost employee).</p>
        <p><strong>Total turnover cost due to lack of structured development:</strong></p>
        <p>15 × R150,000 = R2.25 million per year.</p>
        <p><strong>Targeted Reduction in Turnover Due to Structured Development</strong></p>
        <p>New number of employees without a plan: 30% of 250 employees = 75 employees</p>
        <p>Estimated retention improvement: 25% reduction in turnover risk.</p>
        <p>Employees retained due to structured career development: (148 - 75) × 10% = 7 employees retained per year.</p>
        <p>7 × R150,000 = R1 million prevented cost per year.</p>
